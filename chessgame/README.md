Chess-Like Game
This is a simple turn-based chess-like game implemented using Node.js, WebSockets, and React. Players take turns moving their characters on a 5x5 board, each with unique movement and attack rules. The game supports real-time communication and state updates between the server and connected clients.

Features
Three Character Types:

Pawn (P): Moves one block in a straight line in any direction (Forward, Backward, Left, Right).
Hero1 (H1): Moves two blocks in a straight line. Can eliminate any opponent directly in its path.
Hero2 (H2): Moves two blocks diagonally. Can eliminate any opponent directly in its path.
Real-Time Updates: The game uses WebSockets to keep all connected clients in sync with the current game state, ensuring seamless turn-based play.

Chat Feature: Players can communicate through an in-game chat system that updates in real-time with WebSockets.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess-like-game.git
cd chess-like-game
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the Server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will start on port 4000, and the WebSocket server will run on port 8080.

Start the React App:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm start
The React app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

How to Play
Setup:

On connecting to the server, players are assigned either Player A or Player B and will automatically receive the initial game state.
Making a Move:

Click on a character that belongs to you (denoted by 'A' or 'B' prefix).
Use the directional buttons to move your selected character based on its movement rules.
Turn-Based System:

After a valid move, the turn switches to the other player. The game continues until one player eliminates all the opponentâ€™s characters or a win condition is achieved.
Chat:

Players can send messages using the in-game chat, which updates in real-time. Type your message and hit the "Send" button to communicate with your opponent.
Project Structure
Server (index.js): Manages the WebSocket server, game logic, and broadcasts the game state to connected clients.
Client (client/src/App.js): Implements the React-based game interface, handling the game board display, user input, and chat.
Game Logic: Controls character movement, move validation, and game state updates.
